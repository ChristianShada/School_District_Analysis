# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This analysis was important as the schools could really dial in a look at specialized data that referenced the different type they were, based on the attributes:<br/>

<br><img align="right" width="300" height="200" src=https://github.com/ChristianShada/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Data_School.png>
- School Type
- Total Students
- Total Budget
- Dollars per Student
- Average Scores of Math, Reading , Both
- Averate Percent of Passing Math, Reading, and Both
- Overall Percent of Passing
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This allows the different districts to find out how they are doing, compare them to others that are similar in school type, budget, and total students. This will give them feedback on how to adjust their teaching structure or continue on teaching as they are. Based on the results per school of course.

### Results<br>
- How is the district summary affected?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;- As Thomas High School is not a part of the District School Type, it was not as affected by the data change. Perhaps if someone was going to do an overall of both. But for our immediate purposese it was not.<br/>
- How is the school summary affected<br/>
&emsp;&emsp; - The overall data, was surprisingly dangerously close to the oroginal. Looking at just the overall data, there are too many students to where on the surface, it was not that influential. The three hundred students at Thomas HS in 9th grade did not shift the results so dramatically.<br/>
- How is the school summary affected<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas HS's performance relative to the other schools?<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;When we learned that we had to take away 9th grade data from Thomas High School, it created new data that was no longer valuable as, in order to make it worth wile, we need to manupulate the data to only see 10th, 11th, and 12th grades for the other schools as well. While you can see the difference in the before data vs. the after data, it may look great and that Thomas High School has lept ahead of other "School Types" We are only meausing three grade levels versus four grade levels of the other schools/districts.

If we are looking at the overall scores within the schools. You can see below that the scores changed slightly. We are changing the data ommiting only 300 students or so against nearly 40,000 students. As such, it will not change dramatically.
